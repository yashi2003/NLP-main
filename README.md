# Text Summarization
Text summarization is the process of condensing a longer piece of text, such as an article, document, or paragraph, into a shorter and more concise version while preserving its key information and meaning. The goal of text summarization is to extract the most important points and main ideas from the original text and present them in a condensed form.
